# Movies Recommendation System üé¨

A content-based movie recommendation system with an interactive **Streamlit web interface**. Built using the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset, this application analyzes movie data and provides personalized recommendations based on content similarity.

```

## üìä Dataset

The project uses the **TMDB 5000 Movies Dataset** which contains:
- **~4,800 movies** from The Movie Database (TMDb)
- **20 features** including budget, genres, keywords, cast, crew, overview, popularity, revenue, runtime, and more
- **JSON-formatted columns** for genres, keywords, cast, and crew

### Key Features:
- `budget`: Movie production budget
- `genres`: Movie genres (Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
- `keywords`: Plot keywords and themes
- `cast`: Top 3 cast members
- `crew`: Director information
- `overview`: Movie plot summary
- `revenue`: Box office revenue
- `vote_average` & `vote_count`: User ratings

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis

The `Notebooks/Movies_EDA.ipynb` notebook includes comprehensive data analysis:

### Data Preprocessing
- Merged movies and credits datasets
- Parsed JSON columns (genres, keywords, cast, crew)
- Handled missing values
- Extracted director information from crew data
- Limited cast to top 3 actors per movie

### Visualizations
1. **Budget vs Revenue Analysis**: Scatter plot showing relationship between production budget and box office revenue
2. **Genre-wise Profit Analysis**: Bar chart displaying average profit margins across different genres
3. **Top Movies by Profit**: Visualization of highest-grossing movies
4. **Distribution Analysis**: Statistical analysis of movie features

### Key Insights
- Identified correlation between budget and revenue
- Analyzed genre profitability patterns
- Discovered top-performing movies and directors

## ü§ñ Recommendation System

The `Notebooks/Movies_Recommendation_Model.ipynb` implements a **content-based filtering** approach:

### Methodology

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created a combined "tag" feature by concatenating:
     - Movie overview
     - Genres
     - Keywords
     - Cast (top 3 actors)
     - Crew (director)

2. **Text Processing**
   - Used `CountVectorizer` from scikit-learn
   - Parameters:
     - `max_features=10000`: Top 10,000 most frequent words
     - Stop words removal for better accuracy
     - Lowercase conversion for consistency

3. **Similarity Calculation**
   - Computed **cosine similarity** matrix between all movies
   - Measures content similarity based on movie features
   - Pre-computed matrix for fast real-time recommendations

4. **Recommendation Functions**
   - `recommend(movie, n=5)`: Get similar movies based on movie title
   - `recommend_by_tags(tags, n=5)`: Get movies matching specific features (genres, cast, director, keywords)

### Model Serialization
- Saved similarity matrix: `Models/similarity.pkl`
- Saved processed dataframe: `Models/movies.pkl`
- Enables quick loading without reprocessing

## üåê Web Application (Streamlit)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Dataset**: The `Data/` folder is not included in the repository due to file size. Download the TMDB 5000 dataset separately.
2. **Virtual Environment**: The `venv/` folder is excluded from version control. Create your own virtual environment locally.
3. **Model Files**: The `Models/` folder should contain pre-built model files. If missing, run the notebooks to generate them.
